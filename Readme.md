#Project 4: Super-Duo

#Project Overview
In this project, you will create an app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and Google Could Endpoints. The finished app will consist of four modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Could Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes, an Android library containing an activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.

## Why this Project
As Android projects grow in complexity, it becomes necessary to customize the behavior of the Gradle build tool, allowing automation of repetitive tasks. Particularly, factoring functionality into libraries and creating product flavors allow for much bigger projects with minimal added complexity.
